## Contributing

Slack : There is a dedicated private channel for Lex. To be part of it, ask @valaymerick for an invite



## Status

We are currently learning the technologies needed to build the app before writing any code. The goal is to be operational before april to start working on a MVP.

## Tech

#### Backend 
The backend will contain blockchain and server related code. We use Python because of its great built-in libraries and ease-of-use. 
Other technologies will likely be added in the long run but for now we will stick with those ones.

##### Technologies :

 - **Python**
 - **Flask**
 - A database system (ex: MongoDB, Redis)
 - UnitTest
 - Git



---

#### Frontend
The front-end will be developed once the blockchain is working. It will contain a user interface letting user send, receive and sign contracts.

##### Technologies  :

 - **HTML/CSS**
 - **Javascript**
 - React
 - Webpack
 - Jest
 - Git
